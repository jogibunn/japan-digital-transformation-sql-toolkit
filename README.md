# Bharat Herald DX Analytics Improvement

![Bharat Herald DX Analytics](docs/github_banner.svg)

This repository is an improved version of a pre-existing Codebasics RPC 17 digital transformation analytics project.  
The original English project files and datasets are preserved, while this version adds deeper SQL data cleaning, a Japanese business report, and a reproducible Python workflow.

## Why I Improved It

Traditional media companies often face the same problem: print revenue is weakening, but digital transformation cannot be decided only by enthusiasm.  
This project rebuilds the original analysis from a consulting perspective:

- Which cities should be prioritized for DX?
- Where is print circulation dropping fastest?
- Which advertising categories create revenue concentration risk?
- Does digital readiness actually convert into pilot engagement?
- How can SQL cleaning make the analysis more reliable?

## My Added Value

| Area | Improvement |
| --- | --- |
| SQL | Added deep cleaning logic with Japanese comments |
| Data quality | Standardized dates, currencies, city names, states, and category keys |
| KPIs | Added return rate, print efficiency, engagement rate, access cost, and DX priority score |
| Python | Built a zero-dependency report generator using SQLite + HTML + SVG |
| Report | Rebuilt the final analysis as a Japanese consulting-style HTML report |
| GitHub presentation | Added a clear project identity, attribution, and reproducible execution steps |

```

## How To Reproduce

Run from the project root:

```powershell
python scripts/build_clean_db.py
python scripts/generate_japanese_report.py
```

Generated outputs:

- `improved_outputs/bharat_herald_cleaned.sqlite`
- `improved_outputs/bharat_herald_dx_report_jp.html`

The SQLite file is intentionally ignored by git because it can be regenerated.

## Cleaning Logic

The improved SQL workflow creates normalized tables and views:

- `clean_dim_city`
- `clean_dim_ad_category`
- `clean_fact_print_sales`
- `clean_fact_ad_revenue`
- `clean_fact_city_readiness`
- `clean_fact_digital_pilot`
- `v_data_quality_summary`
- `v_print_monthly_momentum`
- `v_ad_category_concentration`
- `v_city_dx_priority`
- `v_executive_kpi`

Main cleaning points:

- Convert mixed quarter formats such as `2023-Q2`, `Q1-2019`, and `4th Qtr 2020`
- Convert mixed currencies into INR using fixed analysis rates
- Standardize city and state names
- Detect print logic inconsistencies
- Flag invalid revenue and readiness values
- Create consulting-oriented DX priority scoring

## Key Findings From The Improved Analysis

- 2024 net circulation: `29,597,065`
- 2024 average print efficiency: `94.53%`
- 2024 advertising revenue: `340,349,816 INR`
- Average 2024 DX readiness score: `68.34`
- Average pilot engagement rate: `54.58%`
- Highest DX priority city: `Kanpur`
- Largest monthly circulation drop: `Varanasi`, January 2021, `-59,807`
